# Terminal Renderer

`terminal-renderer` is a 3D renderer that outputs to an ordinary terminal. It uses ANSI escape codes
to color the characters.

# Resolution

The resolution of the ouput is 1x0.5 characters. This is possible because of the half vertical
characters that can be used along with foreground and background colors.
